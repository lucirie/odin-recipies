      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Gather Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook Meat</h3>
    <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare Sauce</h3>
    <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Make Ricotta Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Preheat Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Assemble Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Rest and Serve</h3>
    <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
